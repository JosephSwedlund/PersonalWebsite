    			<h2> My time at ACU:</h2>

			<h3>Social problems.</h3> 
			<p>
        		My time at ACU has been interesting to say the least. I'm not much of a social butterfly, this isn't due
        		to lack of ability. But instead due to lack of shared interests it's been incredibly hard my whole 
        		life to find people who share interests with me. This may be partially because I was homeschooled 
        		but I don't think that was/has been the primary reason. Seeing as my sister was homeschooled as well
        		and didn't have nearly the same issues. Instead I think it was likely largely due to having specific 
        		interests, and always have. These interests tend to be things most people have little interest in, or
        		in some situations  are things that are sometimes even actively taboo to discuss in most situations.
			Things like politics, religion, philosophy, and debate. As well as the hard sciences. 
			</p>
			<p>These things 
        		have always been of incredible interest to me ever since I was a young child. But most people have relatively
        		little interest in these topics. Which of course is reasonable especially as a child or teenager. But even
        		coming into university I am often afraid to speak my mind publically about politics or religion. Not 
        		nesicality because my opinions even differ that much from most peoples, but because it's in my nature to play
        		devil's advocate. So when issues of certain sensitive nature comes up I tend to be the one arguing or attempting
        		to poke holes in the common accepted idea, and while faculty tend to be encouraging of this type of argumentation
        		many students are far too emotionally tied to their ideas for me to be comfortable bringing up due to my 
        		desire to not upset others. That being said my more common interests are also somewhat of an issue, as I tend to have very focused tastes
			at any given time. And as of almost my whole university career my primary hobbie/interests outside of the 
			aforementioned philosophy, religion, politics, and science, has been Overwatch, again not something which is super
        		prevalent especially given the last several years have seen basically no new content added to the game. 
        		All that to say, I've tended to stay pretty much at arms length from most people at ACU, though I do consider
        		a few, friends never have I considered them close friends. </p>


			<h3>Academia.</h3>
			<p>
        		Academically speaking, my time at ACU has been very fulfilling overall, I do think a lot of classes can sometimes
        		tend to get a little dogmatic when it comes to specific religious ideas. But this is to be expected at a religiously 
        		affiliated institute I suppose. But my major classes have rarely suffered from this dogma, as in these classes
        		it more comes across as the professors simply stating their opinion. For example Dr. Homer's opinion on Human like
        		Artificial Intelligence which he always premised with the fact that while he thinks that sentiances comes from
        		a soul which he does not think can be simulated to any reasonable degree in a digital form it does not mean
        		that he is absolutely certain nor does it mean that we can't disagree with him. Which sadly is an example of humbleness
        		some professors at ACU seem to often lack when it comes to religious/religiously affiliated ideas.
			</p><p>
        		All that being said as mentioned above my overall experience has been very fulfilling and I hope to at some point
        		attend grad school. I may even do so repeatedly. I simply enjoy the academic experience even for all its stressors
        		and shortcomes. I think my favorite classes have to have been, Programming II, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Graphics
        		and the 3D modeling class, and Advanced Security class I'm currently in this semester. 
			</p>
        
			<h3>What I wish I had done differently:</h3>
			<p>
        		I do think it would likely have been more emotionally satiating if I had pursued some form of social group
        		or romantic relationship while on campus. But I think not only would that have made several things I mention below
        		in my spiritual journey reflections much harder on me, it would have likely spread some of those hardships to 
        		others which is something I would prefer to not have done. Plus another positive of not having any substantially safety net
        		at ACU specifically or friend groups/romantic affilations is the fact that I think transitioning out of University
        		into work at USAA next fall will be much easier for me than it will be for most people who are not just changing city and daily activity
        		but who are also likely losing contact with their friend and often people they consider family. This
        		is fortunately something I won't have to suffer from as much as many. But I do think my biggest regrets
        		are certainly social in nature.

    			<h2>Spiritual Journey at ACU:</h2>
        		
			<p>
        		I don't consider myself to be a spiritual person, I personally think the foundation of most peoples spirituality is 
        		simply their emotional desire for a larger purpose combined with a sense of belonging. Personally I've 
        		always felt that understanding the truth, and attempting to be impartial should always come first. Due to
        		this I have very little to say on this topic. 

        		That being said, I can discuss some of the interesting philosophical changes I've gone through over the last
        		five years. I would say the three largest philosophical changes that have occured in me are as follows
        		Epistemological, my thoughts on free will, and finally my current situation of attempting to construct a
        		reasonable system of frameworks
			<p>

        		<h3>Epistemology:</h3>
			<p>
			My epistemology has changed quite a bit in the last 7 years. Primarily I've slowly become a skeptic as
        		far as dealing with claims of truth goes. I ended up getting myself into the position of a empericest. 
        		I think that all knowledge it is possible to have either comes directly from observation or from a logical
        		extension of that observation, but even that logical framework is built off of observation. Meaning to me
			observation is the root of all knowledge. Now as you may expect, throwing away your whole identity and 
			worldview simply because you believe you may have found a more accurete way to seek truth isn't always an easy task. 
			If I were psychologically inclined I could argue that such revvolation is somewhat traumatic. That destruction of your worldview
			in a simple attempt to be a sure as possible is pretty clearly detrimental to your mental health. 
			with this I would agree.

			<p> But I think that taking such actions simply to make sure what you think is real is real,
			is something that everyone should go through. But I understand that the act of going through such a thing can have
        		lasting negative mental side effects. The act of deconstructing your own worldview is easily compariable
        		to an act of philosophical suicide. You kill your identity, your perspective. All just for the chance of
        		understanding something better. And while this action has been beneficial to me personally and I wouldn't
        		change it. It is something I'm split on encouraging others to do. Simply due to the great anguish it can 
        		cause, the sense of hopelessness and loss of self. It is certainly not something I would typically recommend for the
        		faint of heart nor the currently mentally unstable. 
			</p>

        		<h3>Free Will</h3>
			<p>
			As an example of something I have changed my view on (maybe 3 years ago?) is the topic of free will. I
        		used to, as many do. Take it for granted as something that is seemingly obviously true. And a natural 
        		aspect of the universe. That being said after some careful consideration. I've come to the conclusion that
        		based on all the current scientific information we have on the topic, as well as the philosophical argumentation
        		that I cannot in good consciousness hold or argue for free will's existence. What I took as something 
        		obviously true, I realized wasn't free will, but instead the feeling of free will. Which I DO still assert
        		is which is self evidently true. But as the feeling of "Chocolate is the best flavor" doesn't MAKE chocolates
        		"bestness" a true thing about the universe neither does the feeling of having free will make free will a 
        		true thing about the universe. Personally I've yet to hear a single truly reasonable argument for such a 
        		things existence. 
			</p>

        		<h3>Framework building:</h3>
			<p>
			After a death there is often a rebirth, both in spiritual and mythological texts from around the earth. 
        		For me as well there was a rebirth. After over years of commiting my so called "Philosophical Suicide"
        		I am now at a point of rebuilding. My lowest low unfortunately came alongside some of the most stressful
        		and sleep deprived semesters. That low was so incredibly low I ended up going to therapy to 
        		talk to someone about it. Unfornately this was very little help as I didn't feel I could discuss such things
        		with them. That being said having had awhile away from school, accepting the truth of the nihilistic reality 
        		I found myself looking at, acknowledging it and moving on to slowly beginning to rebuild a new personal series
       			 of frameworks, once which as any are built on assumptions, are at least this time built on assumptions I'm
        		making, and know I'm making. Ones I can attempt to keep as simple as possible, and limit as many as I can
        		to things which are seemingly self evidently true as possible. I think I'm on the path to stabilizing 
        		myself with those much needed frameworks. But this time ones I can truly get behind. And while it likely 
        		won't ever be finished completely at least I will finally be to the stage of building, and mildly reworking
        		as opposed to that dreadful stage which is simply annihilating.
			</p>
			<p>
			As a last note I've actually recently been considering attempting to join a monastery or other somewhat isolated religious place of study
        		simply as a way to escape the world a bit in my rebuilding process. But I don't think it is likely at this point. I still wouldn't 
        		be opposed to doing so some point later in the future.
