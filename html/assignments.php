				<h2>Website</h2>
				
				<img src="website.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Image of website made in my webdev class"> 
				<p>This was a website I made for my webdev class several years ago, the image is simply the front page. I do like the design
					but as can be seen from my current website swedlund.org I've taken a bit of a more simplistic approach to webdesign. I may as some
					point go back to my more modern style of web design. But I think the minimism of my current site more accrualty reflex my philosophy related
					to technology use.</p>				
				<p>I don't quite remember what the assignment I did this for was about but I do recall very much enjoying the process. I think this was the class
					I realized I like working on software where I can visually see the end result in the form of UI or graphics of some kind. Before this class I 						really care one way or the other. 
					</p>				
				<p>It was actually what lead to me asking for a team with graphical feedback during my internship with USAA which was a wonderful experience and lead 
					to a team I will likely be working with for a few years at the very least. </p>				

				<h2>Graphics</h2>
						
				<img src="yoshi.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Image of 3D dino made in OpenGL"> 
				<p>This was an assignment for my compuer graphics class. Overall one of the main things I recall it being was stressful, but it was less the 
				class/assignemnt and more the fact that out of my 5 classes that semester 3 of them including this one were still in such a state of grade flux that
				upon the semester ended I still could've gotten anything from F's to A's in all of those classes, this meant that just purely based on the ungraded
				assignments in those 3 classes I had about 40-60% of each of those classes grades ungraded as the semester ended. Luckly I got B's and A's in them all
				but it was still a highly stressful time.</p>				
				<p>I do think what I learned most from this experience on a personal level was how to not worry about things no longer in my control. Or at least 
					attempt to. I feel like this is a very valuable skill to have in life in general. When a lot of stressful things are out of your control
					it is better to not let the stress eat you up.</p>				
				<p>on a more academic less philosophical note I really enjoyed this assignment as well as the class overall, I've been interested in graphics 
					programming for several years. And even though the class itself used a old/unsupported version of the OpenGL graphics  API it still 
					let me explore that space. Which I am glad for, I still am hoping to get my feet wet with either Modern OpenGL or with the Vulkan API at
					some point in the future.</p>				
	
				<h2>AI</h2>
				
				<img src="code.png" style="width: 100%" alt="AI Source Code Image"> 
				<p>This project was for my introduction to AI class, it was a genetic algorithm which emulated evolutionary mutation and (artificial) selection
					mine personally was written in PHP, it was just shy of 600 lines of code. which I feel is decently small for not even cutting out empty or 
					comment lines. It was a very fun project, most likely my favorite one in that class. Which is saying something because all of the projects
					from that class were increadibly good. The purpose of the AI was do develop a selected "gene" which could maximize profit on the stock
					market given our limited sample size I feel like we all has some decent outcomes.</p>				
				<p>I don't think I have much to say on a personal note about this assignment but it was very enjoyable to do. I will most likely look into taking
					some more AI classes when I go to grad school at some point.</p>				
				<p>I do wish that for that class we could've had a chance to work on more powerful computers to make more powerful AI's but I understand that 
					the scope of the class was reletively small and we needed to cover more than just 1-2 types of AI so we were limited in scope.</p>				

				<h2>Ship App Design</h2>
					
				<img src="space.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Image of space app design"> 
				<p>This assignment was one completed for my HCI course. It was a hypothetical design for an app, we did several iteratoins on the design getting feed
					back every time. The overall experience wasn't that great but I think that was simply because both my partner for the project and I were
					both rather busy and didn't have super similar schedules/working styles making the project itself somewhat lacking imo. But it seemed to 
					turn out well overall.</p>				
				<p>The bigger things I feel like I learned from this was 1: how difficult it can be to make inital designs intuitve and unique at the same time
					this is a useful insite for me in the future. Even more so because I will be working on the frontend of a mobile application come fall. But
					I won't be the one doing the design work on it, at least not intially who know where I will transition to over time.</p>
				
				<p>I also think knowing that I am capible of working with someone who is very different from me while both having very diffrent schedules I think 
					let me build some confidence that makes me not too worried about going into the professoinal sector upon graduation</p>
