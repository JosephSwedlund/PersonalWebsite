				<h2>My On Campus Internship</h2>			
				<img src="ACU-VTR-Grant-1.jpg" style="width:100%;"alt="Internship With NEXT"> I can be seen here in the blue shirt, 
				with several other people who were working on the NEXT project. 
				<p>I worked over the summer of 2020 at the NEXT lab at ACU. NEXT (Nuclear Energy eXperimental Testing) is a lab where they as the name implies
					work on experimental nuclear energy technologies. I interned with them which was both for a grade as well as for the experience.</p>
				<p>Overall it was an interesting experience I feel like out of the 3 Tech related jobs I've had so far in this one I certianly learned the most
				I was working on a distributed computing sensor technology originally created for science research in the 90s. I tended to use SSH to access a Linux
				machine to work on, and I learned a decent about both linux and distributed computing from this experince. Or less about it in theory and more about
				the specific software we were using a two decades old piece of C++ 98 code.</p>
				<p>I do think that I would like to potentially work in a scientific setting again at some point, I enjoyed the meeting of the minds and being able to
					regularly interact with people who were experts in a field unique from my own. It was also the first year of COVID-19 being a major thing
					so it ended up being a lot more stressful than my other experinces. As far as work goes. It was kind of before people knew how bad
					it was, and the survial rates were still basically unknown.</p>

				<h2>Tutoring</h2>
				<img src="whiteboard.png" style="width:100%;"alt="white board with writting image"> 
				<p>I was a tutor for the SITC several times over the course of my time here at ACU, once for Databases, and once for Networking.
					neither of these classes had much in the way of students looking for help sadly, at least not compared to most classes.
					even then I did get to hang out with the other tutors and sometimes would help other peoples students if they a certian tutor was overrun.</p>
				<p>I very much enjoyed my time as a tutor and I've actively looked for other ways I could potentally teach or help people learn things ever since. 
					I personally very much value education and learning. So I think the fact that I enjoy teaching etc is something that is simply built into
					my personality as a base level.</p>
				<p>Ever since tutoring I have considered working as a teacher or professor several times and still think I may after working in the industry for a
					time. Going back to academia seems like it could be an interesting things to do later in my career perhaps obtaining a Doctoral degree at some
					point and going forward in my older years as a university professor. But decisoins about such things are years from mattering at this point. 
					Still this is something I will keep in mind.</p>
