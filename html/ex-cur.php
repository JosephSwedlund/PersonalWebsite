				<h2>USAA Internship</h2>
				
				<img src="USAA.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Image of my USAA challenge accepted card">
				<p>Over the Summer of 2021 I interned with USAA as a software developer working on their andriod app. The internship was fully online. Over the
					course of the summer I developed and deployed a new feature in the application. A fellow ACU student (now alumus) Caleb Jackson was on
					my team but as an Andriod Developer he started full time about half way through my internship. In the end I got and accepted an offer for
					full time employment with that team and will be starting there in the fall of this year. This internship was not for school credit so I
					figured this was the most reasonable place for it to go in this portfolio.</p>					
				<p>Overall the intership was very enjoyable my team was great. Overall it was a wonderfull experince. They do have a very strong missions to help
					their memebers, which is something I found very nice the coporate culture seemed pretty great and there were enough fun interesting things
					to do that more than counteracted some of the more generally tedium of coporate jobs training videos etc.</p>									<p>I'm very glad I'll be having a chance to work with my team again even if I'll only be able to see one or two of them in the office regulalry as
					most of them are in San Antonio and I'll be working out of the Plano Offices. I would very much recommend people taking the offer and doing an
					internship with them if they are ever given the chance.</p>					

				<h2>Work on Campus</h2>
				<img src="work.png" style="width:100%;"alt="work on campus">
				<p>I worked on Campus as a Web/Enterprise Software Developer with "Enterprise Applications" the group that runs my.acu and other university 
					technologies. This is a job I no longer have and I know a few other students have been doing it for awhile</p> 
				<p>I feel like I learned more about myself than about work during that job as I often felt like I had nothing to do, this was offten because I had
				very little in the way of guidence or instrution, I was basically left in a room by myself and was kind of given freee reign
				I was also told to ask if I had any questions.</p>					
				<p>I feel like the biggest thing I learned from this was I need at least some form of management at least when I'm learning the basics otherwise I 
					tend to get caught in the learning cycle and never get much done, especially when I'm not given specific tasks to complete, like jira stories
					etc. I did leave mostly because I felt kind of bad being paid for how little work I was doing. And seeing as they already had a 
					few new students at that time I figured it was a good time to leave. Even more so due to the fact that my upcoming classes the next semester
					were meant to be of higher difficulty. </p>
